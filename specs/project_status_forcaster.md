# Project Status Forcast

Software Development, like the weather, is a chaotic system. However, we try to make extremely long-term plans around software development.

This app intents to communicate that long-term software planning is silly, just as in weather.

1. A short-range forecast is a forecast made for a time period up to 48 hours.
2. Extended forecasts are for a period extending beyond three or more days (eg. a three to five-day period) from the day of issuance.
3. Medium range forecasts are for a period extending from about three days to seven days in advance.
4. Long-range forecasts are for a period greater than seven days in advance but there are no absolute limits to the period.
